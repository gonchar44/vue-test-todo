### `Attention!`
To run the project you need node version 18. There is .nvmrc file in the root of project, so you can just run
```
nvm use
```

### `Project setup`
Firstly install all packages
```
yarn install
```

### `Set the .env file`
Just copy all data from .env.example file to .env, as .env is in .gitignore, I left the data for you in .env.example

### `Run the project`
The last step is just run the project
```
yarn serve
```
